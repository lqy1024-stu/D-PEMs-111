I hope they gain their freedom soon.\nIf you must do something like this know that you will not have the support of the state government behind you. \nThat being said, Feds don't like negative publicity so get the Elders involved.

Site C will cost $8-10 million per MW. That means we won't be selling expensive power to our neighbours.

In all those years, I have never heard anyone describe pidgin as broken or for the stupid.  I've known people who were fascinated and intrigued by it but never considered it broken or the people who spoke it stupid.  Using pidgin to communicate in certain circumstances and contexts is one thing.  Yes, there IS a time and place for it.  Teaching students to speak it in public schools?

A 1% slowing down of global warming after 80 years!  In other words, it would make a tiny difference.  THAT'S \"IF COUNTRIES ABIDED BY THEIR PLEDGES IN THE DEAL!\"  A non-binding agreement that has no teeth.  Let's see, I wonder how many countries would keep their promises when nothing would happen if they didn't.  I would bet the U.S. would be one of the stupid countries that actually kept or tried to keep their promises while the rest of the world laughed at us.\nWe would have to pay $3 bill a year to countries like China and India who don't have to do anything for years!

No, what people think they are doing isn't logic. Logic is a set of rules. To think logically you have to know those rules, and apply those rules (much like algebra is a set of rules you have to know and apply to get the right answer).\nTo think you can be logical without studying philosophy is like claiming you can do algebra without learning to count first. \nHere's how it works:\nPhilosophers figure out how to understand things.\nScientists use those techniques to understand a particular thing.\nEngineers use that understanding to solve practical problems.\nUnfortunately - because true logic is so often counter-intuitive, those not schooled in it tend to think actual logical arguments are \"stupid\" because their intuition says so."

Rather than be a government in waiting, they have emulated used car salesmen trying to close the deal.\nThis won't end well and sadly for the Greens and NDP they will be on the receiving end. They will look like idiots voting down a throne speech that included major items they initially campaigned on. Many will ask, wasn't that what proportional representation was about, working across party lines. And when BC goes back to the polls again in the next few months, many will ask why was the throne speech voted down if this was your position. \nIn the end another Liberal majority. Hasn't anyone in the NDP or Greens wondered why the Liberals are recalling the legislature? There must be some smarts in that group, or is there?"

When a good leader walk in to a room, his presence and influence can be prevalent inside the room and that bursting energy can inspire even the marginal players to perform superbly.  Instead of putting the QB under the microscope, the Broncos need to put the mirror in front of them and look at the whole team to find out what can they do convert these untrained sloppy recruits to the invincible Navy Seal Team."

That's the diversion tactic you right wingers need -- ignore what was said and attack your own straw man. SYria used chemical weapons and Obama responded, and they didn't do it again until Trump was president, then he wasted a shipload of cruise missiles on an airfield that was **back in operation the next day** PLUS Trump called ahead to warn them he was gonna do that. Some slapdown! LOL!!\nYou have got to be kidding if you think anyone fears crossing Trump. He's a chump."

OOOPS. \nVaughn also seems to conveniently forget that Germany is a country in which over 22% of residents are not born in Germany. This fact completely and utterly destroys the writer's claims about inherent German xenophobia.\nVaughn's attempts to ground current German attitudes and behavior in Prussia and the Soviet occupation is like me trying to say that Canadians love to travel because of Canada's experience in the fur trade; or saying that Canadians are anti-American because of the war of 1812. Just plain stupid.\nVaughn should maybe get away from the Starbucks in Kreuzberg where he probably wrote this swill and actually learn something about Germans and their history and culture."

We caught a few glimpses of it from Osweiler in his first starts as a Bronco.Can't say that Lynch has shown any signs yet, but to be fair he has pretty high expectations. Sometimes players lose that mental edge and hard to get it back in focus. In my eyes Lynch lost confidence when it wasn't happening and coming together for him.

That process is both political and judicial, and it necessarily involves a full explication of the evidence, and provides for the president's right to mount an aggressive defense. If he survives that process, then so be it; but if he is removed, it is utterly important for the evidence against him be laid out for the people of the United States and the world to see.\nAs candidate and as president, Trump has expressed his contempt for the American people, their government and their institutions.

You cannot blame anyone else but yourself.  Whistling racism to the white trash have brought you where you are.  I'm sure you will have a voice at the convention in Cleveland.  So quit whining and get moving before the it's too late"

There's a reason Abraham Lincoln surrounded Lee's house in Virginia with the northern war dead. Because Lee was a hateful and willing participant in a treasonous racist movement that cost this country 500,000 lives.

My cousin applied for and was accepted for the Deaconate program in our diocese.  After about 3 months, he received a call from someone telling him he was rejected from the program.  They at first refused to provide the reasons why: it took some time to learn that his wife, who was unable to adjust her work schedule, could not attend the required meetings for wives, and so they threw my cousin out.  As if we have too many Deacons  in the first place.  Church idiots."

The flag means many things to all kinds of Americans. \nMany of the same Trump supporters who suggest that anyone who burns a flag should lose their citizenship sport the flag on their undergarments or cut holes in the flag and wear it under their arm pits. Their patriotism is so overblown as to suggest an inferiority complex. Quiet patriots know America's strength is in its diverse and educated people.\nTrump needed the help of a foreign government that spies on the U.S. in order to get elected so his patriotism seems quite self-serving but who but a fool would expect more from a rich guy who avoided service with 5 deferments? I assume the Armed Services were much better off without a guy Donald Trump. Everyone's heard his disrespectful opinions about prisoners of war."

        "output": "Pimienta voluntarily moved from Columbia to a country where 75% of the population is white and then is overtly racist against the majority of Canadians.  NICE!  I wish there wasn't racism in Canada but she has added to it with her bigotry and divisiveness.  One good thing about the Halifax incident is that bookers of shows and festivals can now decide if Pimienta's talent outweighs her unpleasantness and potential for creating conflict.  (Ironically, she wants to tour Europe, the source of horrible white people.)  I happen to be white but know so many brown people as cousins, friends and fine co-workers that I think I know why there hasn't been an outpouring of denunciations of Pimienta's back-of-the-bus-ism from people \"of colour\".   I won't insult my personal contacts by asking their opinions of her discriminatory behaviour.   But I can imagine their responses: shakes of heads and huffs of dismissal at her nasty nonsense."
